these are the scripts used on the build server to automatically generate
the various development snapshots (toolchain/u-boot/uclinux-dist/etc...).

the main file you're concerned with is:
	nightly-snaps

it assumes a filesystem layout like so:
	/usr/local/src/blackfin/
	 |- svn/
	 |  |- update -> toolchain/trunk/distribution/snapshots/update-svn
	 |  |- toolchain/
	 |  \- uclinux-dist/
	 |- git/
	 |  |- update -> toolchain/distribution/snapshots/update-git
	 |  |- linux-kernel/
	 |  |- toolchain/
	 |  \- u-boot/
	 |- nightly/
	 \- toolchains/
	    \- build-toolchain -> ../git/toolchain/distribution/snapshots/build-toolchain

the nightly dir will be automatically created and populated with log files
as the script runs

the toolchains dir too will be automatically created and used to store the
generated Blackfin toolchains.  by default, Linux 32bit and 64bit builds
are done, as well as Win32.

the svn/git trees are not created automatically for you.  you'll need to
check things out yourself.  note: you could probably get away with only
checking out the uclinux-dist from svn as git is generally preferred due
to the increased speed.
