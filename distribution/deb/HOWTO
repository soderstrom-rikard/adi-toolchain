Building Debian Packages
------------------------

----------
 Overview
----------

First you need the release toolchain tarballs.  We will take those, unpack
them, and then create binary .deb packages.

Most of the time, this will be run on the gforge server itself, so the default
search path will be the gforge directory:
	/var/lib/gforge/filesystem/frsrelease/

When the scripts are done, the .deb files (among other things) will be placed
in the $PWD/output/ folder.  Simply move those to the Debian tree.  On the
server, you can find it here:
	/var/lib/gforge/filesystem/distros/debian/
You'll want to put the i386 files in the stable i386 subdir.

The Debian tree needs to have its metadata files regenerated, so do that now.
Go into each dir with updated .deb files and simply run `make`.

-------------
 Perquisites
-------------

You'll need all the Debian helper packages installed.  Such as:
	debhelper
	dpkg-dev

To sign them, you'll also need to install gnupg.

------
 Misc
------

The debian/ subdir contains random control files used during the creation of
the .deb archives.
