First you need the ADI certificate.  It has a SHA1 hash of:
	B61F9B648BB7B0A397809567880A4E90168A1678
With that and the cached verisign cross-certificate (MSCV-VSClass3.cer), you
can sign drivers (code) using the batch files in this dir.

The tools subdir is used to hold 'inf2cat' and 'signtool' which are part of the
WDK.  Since MS doesn't allow these to be redistributed, you'll have to get them
yourself from here:
	http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/WDK/WDKpkg.mspx

The Makefile above has a target to create the dir of files you'll need to sign.

Then simply run the inf2cat.bat to create the .cat files followed by the
sign.bat to sign all the driver files.
