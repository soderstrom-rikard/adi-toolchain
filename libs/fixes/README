This directory contains the sed scripts which are used to fix various
aspects of VDSP source code when being ported to GCC land.

fix.sh is the driver shell script. It accepts one argument, which could be
a file name or directory name. fix.sh applies all sed script one by one on
file (if the argument is a file) or each file in the directory (if the
argument is a directory).
