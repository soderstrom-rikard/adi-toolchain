This directory contains a bunch of GDB functions to help automate/streamline
common things debugging Blackfin code.  Some of this will work regardless of
gdb session, while others will only work under JTAG or KGDB.

You can use these in a few different ways:
	* use the "source" command in the gdb cmdline
	* add a "source" command to your ~/.gdbinit or $PWD/.gdbinit
	* copy and paste them into your own files

At runtime, simply use the "help" command for more info:
	(gdb) help regs
	Usage: regs
	Display the common core registers in a compact format.

These snippets are released into the public domain.  Do whatever you like.
