Hi,

The ptrace function defined in uClinux-dist/uClibc/libc/sysdeps/linux/frio/ptrace.c
is obsolete in 0.9,26 uClibc library. It's implementation is already
defined in uClinux-dist/uClibc/libc/sysdeps/linux/common/ptrace.c.

So please remove the ptrace.c entry in uClinux-dist/uClibc/libc/sysdeps/linux/frio/Makefile.
then give make clean in uClinux-dist followed by a make.
This should solve your problem.

Also please make sure that there is a dependeny on string support for 
gdbserver. So please under uClibc menuconfig enable the following.

"Support sys_errlist[] (obsolete-compat)"  
under "String snd Stdio support" --->submenu.

regards,

Srinidhi K

Hi,

    I was trying to build the uClinux-dist/user/gdbserver and got the 
following error in libc.

bfin-elf-gcc -L/home2/sri/uClinux-dist/uClibc/libc/ 
-L/home2/sri/uClinux-dist/uClibc/lib/ -o gdbserver utils.o low-linux.o 
server.o remote-utils.o  
/home2/sri/uClinux-dist/uClibc/libc//libc.a(ptrace.o)(.text+0x24): In 
function `_ptrace':
: undefined reference to `___ptrace'

have a look at this and update me.

Regards,
Raja
