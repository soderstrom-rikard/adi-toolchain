@chapter Introduction

@cindex gdbproxy
@cindex target
@cindex labslave

The  @code{gdbproxy} program is a gdbvsever-like application for embedded
environment. The main purpose of @code{gdbproxy} is it allow truly remote 
debugging working as an integral part of the set of utilities called 
Labslave. It is supposed to be run on the computer located near a system
being debugged. It communicates with debugger over net using standard GDP
remote protocol. It incorporates a number of targets which allow it to hook
up a system being debugged.

There are number of established ways to do remote debugging, let us compare
the @code{gdbproxy} with a terminal server and with telnetting into the lab
machine.

Comparing to a terminal server @code{gdbproxy} has the following advantages: 
(1)terminal server supports only one target, (2)lab machine could be 
used for a wide variety of tasks, for example it can provide bootp, nfs
and syslog services for a device under debugging, (3) other components of 
a lab slave could be run on the same lab machine.

Comparing to a telnetting into lab machine the @code{gdbproxy} has the following 
advantages: (1) it does not require lab machine to mount source directories
(it reduces administrative needs of a lab machine and its bandwidth
rquirements), (2) its bandwidth requitrements are low, debugger is more 
responsive and its traffic could be easily encrypted, so remote device could
be truly debugged across the open (and slow) Internet.

Also the @code{gdbproxy} has the unique advantage of merging cross platform 
problems. For example if one has @sc{gnu} developement environment 
running on SUN and particular ICE (e.g. wiggler) is accessible only 
from WinNT. Then one could use WinNT port of the Labslave on the 
lab machine and effectively use remote debugger on SUNs.

The @code{gdbproxy} does not require to be configured and it is 
able to support wide variety of processors and debugging instruments
in the same image.

translated target responses to the GBP protocol commands and send them
back to the debugger.

During a @code{GDB} session using @code{gdbproxy}, several monitor commands
can be used to send special requests to @code{gdbproxy}.
Here are the available target independent commands.

@table @code
@item monitor help
Print the available monitor commands, both target independent and
target dependent ones.

@item monitor set debug @var{level}

The target `bfin' is using JTAG cable to debug Blackfin processor
of Analog Devices, Inc. Currently, it only supports IGLOO JTAG
cable, which is a parallel port JTAG ICE and compatible with
WIGGLER JTAG cable.

@table @code
@item --board=@var{board}
Specify the board. The @var{board} can be one of
@code{bf533-stamp}, @code{bf533-ezkit}, @code{bf537-stamp},
@code{bf537-ezkit}, @code{bf548-ezkit}, and @code{bf561-ezkit}.
With this option, @code{gdbproxy} will set appropriate SDRAM
size and flash size according the board choosed.

@item --emu-wait=@var{usec}
Wait @var{usec} microseconds in emulation operations.
The default wait time is 5000 microseconds. After each emulator
operation, @code{gdbproxy} will immediately check if Blackfin processor
is @code{EMUREADY}, i.e. if Blackfin processor has executed
all valid instructions in @code{EMUIR} and is ready to execute
the next instruction. If the processor is not @code{EMUREADY},
@code{gdbproxy} will wait @var{usec} microseconds and check again.
If the processor is still not @code{EMUREADY}, @code{gdbproxy}
will failed an assert and abort. @code{gdbproxy} also waits
@var{usec} microseconds for the processor to enter resetting
and complete resetting, if the first check doesn't succeed.

@item --enable-dcache=@var{method}
Enable all data SRAM caches. The @var{method} can be one of
@code{write-through} and @code{write-back}. Default DCPLB entries
will be set up. One DCPLB entry will be used for L1 Bank A Data SRAM.
One DCPLB entry will be used for L1 Bank B Data SRAM. Other
DCPLB entries are used for SDRAM. @code{56MB} SDRAM are covered
by each DCPLB covering @code{4MB}.

@item --enable-icache
Enable all instruction SRAM caches. Default ICPLB entries will
be set up. One ICPLB entry will be used for L1 Instruction SRAM.
Other ICPLB entries are used for SDRAM. @code{60MB} SDRAM are
covered by each ICPLB entry covering @code{4MB}.

@item --flash-size=@var{bytes}
Specify the size of flash in bytes. This option overrides the value
set by @option{--board}.

@item --force-range-wp
Always use range hardware watchpoint. Without this option,
@code{gdbproxy} will only use range hardware watchpoint for
data size larger than 4 bytes, such that we can set up to two
hardware watchpoints with data size less than or equal to 4 bytes.
The watchpoint unit of Blackfin processor triggers emulation
event only when the address on the data bus is equal to watchpoint
address.

@smallexample
struct A @{
  char a;
  char b;
  char c;
  char d;
@} s;
@end smallexample

@code{`(gdb) watch s'} can catch @code{`s.a = 1'}, but can't catch
@code{`s.b = 1'}. If you want to catch writes to all fields of
@code{s}, you can use @option{--force-range-wp}. The cost is
that you can only set one hardware watchpoint.

@item --init-sdram
Initialize SDRAM or DDR memory. The default SDRAM configuration
@code{gdbproxy} set doesn't has the best performance but
maximum flexibility for a large range of system clock frequency.
@code{gdbproxy} uses different configuration for each board.
So @code{gdbproxy} will report an error if you pass @option{--init-sdram}
but don't provide @option{--board}.

@item --loop-wait=@var{usec}
Wait @var{usec} microseconds in wait loop. The default wait time is
10000 microseconds. After resume, @code{gdbproxy} waits @var{usec}
to see if there is any event in the processor should be reported
to gdb. @var{usec} can be @code{0}.

@item --no-auto-switch
Normally, if you are trying to set @code{PC} register with an address
which belongs to the L1 memory of a core other than the current one,
@code{gdbproxy} will automatically switch the current core to that
core and set the address in the @code{PC} register of that core if
that core is not locked or core fault. The switch is done silently.
There will be no notice to user until the next stop.
This option tells @code{gdbproxy} not to automatically switch to
the core whose L1 memory contains the address you set to @code{PC}
register.

@item --reset
Do a core and system reset when gdb connects. @code{gdbproxy}
will automatically do a core and system reset when Blackfin
processor has core faults or in an bad state when gdb connects.
This option asks for a core and systemp reset when gdb connects
without regard to the state of Blackfin processor.

@item --sdram-size=@var{bytes}
Specify the size of SDRAM memory. This option overrides the value
set by @option{--board}.

@item --unlock-on-connect
Unlock all locked cores when gdb connects.

@item --unlock-on-load
Unlock the locked core when loading code to the first address of
its L1 Instruction SRAM.

@item --use-dma
Use DMA to access Instruction SRAM. ITEST/DTEST is used when
possible by default. Using DMA to access Instruction SRAM is slower
than using ITEST/DTEST. But when the latter is used, TEST_COMMAND
is reset to 0, i.e. clobbered! But it should not do any harm to
any reasonable user programs. Only Codes trying to peek TEST_COMMAND
might be affected.

The target `remote' is using remote GDB protocol over serial line to 
connect with device being debugged. Target `extended-remote' is using 
extended version of the GDB protocol. Please, note if your stub does not 
support remote operations, `extended-remote' is not able to detect this
due to protocol deficiency. So, `extended-remote' should be used 
only with stubs which support remote operations.

@table @code
@item --debug
Run remote target in debug mode.

@item --use-break
Send BREAK to stop device being debugged, default is to send Ctrl-C.

@item --baud=@var{baud}
Set baud rate, default is 38400.

@item --timeout=@var{timeout}
Set timeout, default is 2 seconds, minimal value is 1 second, maximum
value is 3600 seconds.

@item @var{device}
