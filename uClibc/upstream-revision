Merged up to 21507, excluding the following revisions for now:

19342
19343
19344
19345
19346
19347
19386

These ones are excluded because they contain the uc_malloc work which IMO
is misguided and shouldn't be applied to our tree.

The following just work around an NPTL bug.  They should not be applied before
the NPTL merge is complete so that we can verify the bug is fixed.
