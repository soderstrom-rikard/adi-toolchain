Merged up to 20727, excluding the following revisions for now:

19342
19343
19344
19345
19346
19347
19386

These ones are excluded because they contain the uc_malloc work which IMO
is misguided and shouldn't be applied to our tree.

The following are excluded because the commit log makes no sense to me.  I've
started discussion on the uClibc mailing list.

20628
