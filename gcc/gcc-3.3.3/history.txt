###### history.txt for gcc-3.3.3 checkins #####
This history file will help in knowing the status of the gcc-3.3.3
port and what to expect next.
If you are working on something, feel free to add that information
here. The port follows the Visual DSP ABI for parameter passing.

Next        :
            - The compiler sometimes generates an incorrect instruction
              such as Rx = [Px + 1].
            - More torture failures
18 Jun 2004 : Fixed
              1. Optimization bug : switch inside loop failure fixed.
              2. Removed nisa calling convention assembly functions
1  Jun 2004 : Modified gcc/config/bfin/bfin.c, bfin.h, bfin.md
              1. R3 was used as fixed register, now i reverted it back.
              2. Movhi, added for Dreg = Preg, Preg = Dreg
              3. reg += i, is added for Dreg, Mreg, Ireg
              4. reg -=Md, is added
              5. in bfin.md: 942, \"%0 +=-%2;\", is removed ( no of constraint was not
                 matching no of template)
              2.6 kernel now builds without internal compiler errors.
              However, gcc torture results worsened!
30 May 2004 : VDSP ABI supported.
              gcc-3.4 tree started. 3.4 port is unstable.
              Recently incorporated correct length info for move
              instruction.
