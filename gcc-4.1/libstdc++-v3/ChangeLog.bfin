	Add several patches from buildroot.
	* configure: Add a hack to make a configure test for complex numbers
	fail if __UCLIBC__.
	* include/ext/rope: Undefine index in case libc defines it as a macro.
	* libstdc++-v3/include/ext/ropeimpl.h: Likewise.
	* include/c_std/std_cstdio.h: Enable a block guarded by
	_GLIBCXX_USE_C99 for __UCLIBC__ as well.
